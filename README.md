# KPMG Frontend Task: Employee List Search
> **Author:** Rachel Tang

<br />

## Background
This application allows users to search through a list of employee names and filter results according to user input, based on the employee's firstname.

## Features
1. Searching is case-insensitive and substring-match based.
    - i.e. The user's query will yield results with any employee's whose firstname contains that query.
2. The table data is compatible with Excel copy-and-pasting.
    - i.e. The data stays in table format across different applications.
3. To submit a search, a user can either:
    1. Use the `return` or `enter` key on their keyboard.
    2. Click the `Search` button adjacent to the search bar on the application.
